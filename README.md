# FizzBuzz in Haskell, property-based

This small code base is an example of doing simple property-based testing
without having to rely too much on partitioning properties into equivalence
classes.

It's the supporting code for the blog post [Property based testing is not the same as partition testing](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/06/28/property-based-testing-is-not-the-same-as-partition-testing).
